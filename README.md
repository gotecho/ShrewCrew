Synopsis

![Shrew Crew - Sprint 1 ERD (5)](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c6764f20-2b85-45c5-bd72-24c2b7e75553)
Our project is to create a texting channel for the 311 hotline that the Sacramento City uses. This texting channel will be able to take in a user's input and respond dynamically to that response. If the user ask a question, then the AI will respond to that question. If the user asks a question about a specific ticket, then the AI will access the ticket in question and respond with the appropriate information. If the user asks to file a ticket, then the AI will be able to gather information from the user and use that information to create a ticket.
