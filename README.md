Our project is to create a texting channel for the 311 hotline that the Sacramento City uses. This texting channel will be able to take in a user's input and respond dynamically to that response. If the user assk a question, then the AI will respond to that question. If the user asks a question about a specific ticket, then the AI will access the ticket in question and respond with the appropriate information. If the user asks to file a ticket, then the AI will be able to gather information from the user and use that information to create a ticket.
